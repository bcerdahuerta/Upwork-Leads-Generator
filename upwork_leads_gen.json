I would like to create a dashboard using scraped data from coinmarketcap.com Essentially, I would like to pull down every coin listed on the site and have a spreadsheet like interface where I can view the following columns: Name of Coin Ticker Price: Current trading price, 24 hour price change, 1 week price change etc... Market Cap: Basic Market Cap, Fully Diluted Market Cap Watchlist: How many watchlists is this on, 24 change, 7 day change, 30 day change, 90 day change (important to confirm if this is possible) Volume: 24 hour volume, 24 hour volume change, 1 week volume change etc... High / Low: 24 hour, 7 day, 30 day, 90 day, All time Supply: Circulating Supply, Total Supply I would like the list to refresh as often as once every 30 minutes (although if less frequent it may be fine) I would also like the dashboard to be filterable (i.e., I can filter coins that are on 500+ watchlists, over $100MM market cap, and increased in price by 25% in last 24 hours) Also I would like to be able to sort the coins on any of the dimensions above (even if a filter is being used - so if I had the filter above activated, I also then want to be able to sort that subset by market cap). The changes would all be in percentage. Each coin would be a separate row and category would be a separate column. Ideally this is not done in excel, but rather a more visual dashboard. I would also like access to the excel backup data if possible (but no worries if not) Let me know if you are interested in the project.

Let\\\\\\'s say from the start that I don\\\\\\'t have much experience with computer science, so I leave you carte blanche on much of the design and programming. I intend to base the program on an external host of your choice (choose the best). My idea is to take advantage of the delays in the game of roulette, therefore not basing the probabilities on a mathematical basis, but on a historical basis (the same color / parity has never come out more than 32 times, and from these data I have derived probabilities) . The program in short is supposed to alert me to the seventh element of a sequence (color or parity) so that I can play starting from the ninth delay on the same sequence; in case the sequence continues I double the amount bet up to 5 times. Speaking of the technical aspect, the program collects data from one of these sites (web scraping): 888, leovegas, starcasin\\xf2, eurobet, goldbet (as far as I know you should be logged in the lobby) and from these 5 roulettes: ROULETTE OF VENICE SPEED ROULETTE VIP ROULETTE IMMERSIVE ROULETTE ROULETTE. The program then analyzes the data collected from the spins of the aforementioned roulette wheels and detects whether there is a sequence of colors or parity between the numbers analyzed. At this point, with a delay not exceeding 30 seconds, the program sends a notification on a telegram channel (id: -1001268239466) when a sequence of 7 equal spins is detected. The notification must advise on which roulette the sequence is and the type of sequence (eg \"Venezia Roulette 7 Nero\" - the notification must be in Italian so black = nero, red = rosso, even = pari, odd = dispari). Finally, every week the program sends the data report on the same telegram channel (tell me if this feature is feasible): the message must contain the history of the bets and whether they have been successful or not (considering valid the result starting from the ninth element of the sequence) As for the APIs, I\\\\\\'m not at all sure how they can be used in such a program.\\', \\'Need an expert Lead generation specialist to find 10,000 US based Shoe Importers.

Its paramount the bot is efficient in sacrificing high gas fees to be one of the first orders placed (front-run) The BOT would essentially: - Scan the blockchain and find transactions based on certain criteria (pending on the block aka mempool). It needs to detect and immediately execute a trade on the same second liquidity to is added to a token, according to my parameters - Front-run (specific trade volumes, slippage, and gas price) transactions by placing a buy order on the same block at the same time by setting a higher gas price. - Sell immediately in the next block right after the buy transaction on the front-ran block is completed. - Send BNB profit from trades to Trust Wallet address after every 4 successful trades. - I would like this to be connected to a Trust Wallet (Bonus Payment for adding MetaMask compatibility) - A simple UI for the bot where I can manage parameters such as : minimum amount of the trade, slippage tolerance, range or amount to put into trades for buy and sell orders, connection to the wallet, the token contract address (one or multiple contracts at the same time), gas price parameters. - A dashboard with all the trades done and where other features can be controlled. GUI would be extra, but the speed and process of the bot are preferred as order timing and placement is obviously the most important. I have a basic node available but will be willing to buy a better node if required. My knowledge is pretty dim on how this will all work which is why I would like an expert to take over but I will provide an example project upon request in case you would like to see or build off of it.

The bot needs to detect it and immediately execute a trade according to my parameters. I need to be able to give the bots my own parameters such as: contract address, gas price, max. buying price of the token, selling price of the token, quantity of tokens to buy/sell. The interface needs to be easy to use. Full source code must be included with the ability to connect to any wallet by signing or entering my private key into the config file IMPORTANT: I would like the option to buy more of the same bot/code for others to use in my family.

Let\\'s say from the start that I don\\'t have much experience with computer science, so I leave you carte blanche on much of the design and programming. I intend to base the program on an external host of your choice (choose the best). My idea is to take advantage of the delays in the game of roulette, therefore not basing the probabilities on a mathematical basis, but on a historical basis (the same color / parity has never come out more than 32 times, and from these data I have derived probabilities) . The program in short is supposed to alert me to the seventh element of a sequence (color or parity) so that I can play starting from the ninth delay on the same sequence; in case the sequence continues I double the amount bet up to 5 times. Speaking of the technical aspect, the program collects data from one of these sites (web scraping): 888, leovegas, starcasinò, eurobet, goldbet (as far as I know you should be logged in the lobby) and from these 5 roulettes: ROULETTE OF VENICE SPEED ROULETTE VIP ROULETTE IMMERSIVE ROULETTE ROULETTE. The program then analyzes the data collected from the spins of the aforementioned roulette wheels and detects whether there is a sequence of colors or parity between the numbers analyzed. At this point, with a delay not exceeding 30 seconds, the program sends a notification on a telegram channel (id: -1001268239466) when a sequence of 7 equal spins is detected. The notification must advise on which roulette the sequence is and the type of sequence (eg \"Venezia Roulette 7 Nero\" - the notification must be in Italian so black = nero, red = rosso, even = pari, odd = dispari). Finally, every week the program sends the data report on the same telegram channel (tell me if this feature is feasible): the message must contain the history of the bets and whether they have been successful or not (considering valid the result starting from the ninth element of the sequence) As for the APIs, I\\'m not at all sure how they can be used in such a program.', 'Need an expert Lead generation specialist to find 10,000 US based Shoe Importers.

Its paramount the bot is efficient in sacrificing high gas fees to be one of the first orders placed (front-run) The BOT would essentially: - Scan the blockchain and find transactions based on certain criteria (pending on the block aka mempool). It needs to detect and immediately execute a trade on the same second liquidity to is added to a token, according to my parameters - Front-run (specific trade volumes, slippage, and gas price) transactions by placing a buy order on the same block at the same time by setting a higher gas price. - Sell immediately in the next block right after the buy transaction on the front-ran block is completed. - Send BNB profit from trades to Trust Wallet address after every 4 successful trades. - I would like this to be connected to a Trust Wallet (Bonus Payment for adding MetaMask compatibility) - A simple UI for the bot where I can manage parameters such as : minimum amount of the trade, slippage tolerance, range or amount to put into trades for buy and sell orders, connection to the wallet, the token contract address (one or multiple contracts at the same time), gas price parameters. - A dashboard with all the trades done and where other features can be controlled. GUI would be extra, but the speed and process of the bot are preferred as order timing and placement is obviously the most important.
